$ gsoc2-cli send-envelope --help
? success

This command will validate and attempt to send an envelope to Gsoc2. Due to network errors, rate
limits or sampling the envelope is not guaranteed to actually arrive. Check debug output for
transmission errors by passing --log-level=debug or setting `GSOC2_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
